# WTWR – What to Wear  

## Overview  

**WTWR** is a responsive React application that suggests clothing items based on current weather conditions. It uses a clean component-based architecture, modular CSS, and custom fonts to align with the project’s Figma design specifications.  

This project is part of the TripleTen Software Engineering Program and demonstrates the transition from vanilla JavaScript projects into modern React development with a structured workflow.

## ⚙️ Development  

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).  

Currently, two official plugins are available for React projects:  

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) – uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## 🧠 Notes  

This project follows the Figma layout standards for typography, spacing, and alignment. The location is currently a placeholder and will later be replaced with API-driven data. Work in progress includes modal functionality, user interaction, and external API integration.
